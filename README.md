# Productive Social
##### _An all-in-one workspace which combines a habit-and-goal-oriented app, a task manager and general self-management app and a journaling-focused app with social media features to share, connect and learn the productive habits of others._

The goal with Productive Social (PS) is to solve a personal problem I have, where there’s a lot of amazing apps to help with specific aspects of self-productivity and self-management, apps that help with goal tracking, apps that help with task management, and apps for journaling (an important aspect of productivity), but there’s no one app that does it all in a completely full feature-pledged way.
There are some Apps that focus on more than one aspect of productivity, a good example is ***Notion***.

### A simple overview on Notion and other apps
The ability to design unlimited designs for notion pages; pages for journaling, pages for goals setting/habit tracking, pages for general management and others, is from my point-of-view the main thing that made _notion_ so popular. It gave people an all-in-one platform for management, journaling and databasing. It was then possible to replace a multitude of different apps with one.
